# Create React App DevOps

This is a repo that proves how easily it is to implement automated builds around [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). In this repo, we do the following:

1. Use Create React App to Get the UI Up
2. Setup Your Server with Node, Express, and Babel
3. Run the App on the Web with Bluemix
4. Automagically Deploy from Github with Travis CI
5. Fetch API Data While Keeping Keys Secure
6. Create a Staging App for Experimentation

There are three ways to implement this in your own Create React App project:

- Follow along with the Medium story to make it yourself
- Inspect the git diff between the initial Create React App use and the final commit
- Fork this repo and follow the instructions below
